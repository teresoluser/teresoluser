	docker –version                                        for docker version check
	docker pull <imageName>                                This command is used to pull images from the docker repository(hub.docker.com)
	docker run -it -d <imageName>                          This command is used to create a container from an image
	docker ps                                              This command is used to list the running containers
	docker ps -a                                           This command is used to show all the running and exited containers
	docker exec  docker exec -it <container id> bash       This command is used to access the running container
	docker stop <container id>                             This command stops a running container
	docker kill <container id>                             This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately. 
	                                                       The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ 
	                                                       gives the container time to shutdown gracefully, in situations when it is taking too much time for getting the container to stop,
